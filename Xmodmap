!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!!remove Control = Control_L
!!keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
!!add Lock = Caps_Lock
!add Control = Control_L

! undo any meta keys already set
clear Mod1
! keycodes 66 and 69 are the option/alt keys;
! assign them as Meta keys
keycode 66=Meta_L
keycode 69=Meta_R
! now tell X11 that the Meta keys act as the Mod1
! (meta) modier key; that is, when they are pressed
! with KEY, it is the same as hitting M-KEY
add Mod1 = Meta_L Meta_R
